                <p>I'm an associate professor of computer science at <a href="https://www.rollins.edu">Rollins College</a> in Winter Park, FL. I teach classes across
                   the computer science curriculum, including introductory programming, simulation, and AI. My textbook, <i>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java: A Project-Based
                       Approach</i> will be published by Cambridge University Press in October 2024.
                </p>

                <p>I founded and lead the Rollins Community Impact Lab, a student research group that conducts impact assessment projects with Central Florida nonprofits. <a href="#impact">Learn more about our work</a>.</p>

                <p>Before joining the Rollins faculty, I received my Ph.D. in computer sciences from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2014, advised by Mary Vernon and Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau.
                    My dissertation developed analytic performance models for storage systems and new approximations for queue length distributions.
                    Prior to attending UW, I worked as a software engineer at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM, applying computer vision
                    algorithms to national security problems. My bachelor's and master's degrees are from the University of Florida.

<li>It's okay to have both positive and negative feelings</li>
<li>The limitations of policing AI use</li>
<li>Moving from delegation to collaboration</li>
<li>The continued relevance of critical thinking, information literacy, and written communication as core skills</li>

<li>Guided activities to practice using AI reflectively</li>
</ul>
 

Session 4: Why AI is weird
