                <p>I'm an associate professor of computer science at <a href="https://www.rollins.edu">Rollins College</a> in Winter Park, FL. I teach classes across
                   the computer science curriculum, including introductory programming, simulation, and AI. My textbook, <i>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java: A Project-Based
                       Approach</i> will be published by Cambridge University Press in October 2024.
                </p>

                <p>My student research group, the Rollins Community Impact Lab, conducts impact assessment projects with
                    Central Florida nonprofits. <a href="#impact">Learn more about our work.</a></p>

                <p> Since the introduction of ChatGPT, I've been heavily involved in writing and speaking about new AI tools with faculty, community groups, and the 
                    local media. I offer <a href="#ai">hands-on faculty development workshops</a> that provide concerete models for collaborative,
                    reflective teaching and learning with AI.</p>

                <p>Before joining the Rollins faculty, I received my Ph.D. in computer sciences from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2014, advised by Mary Vernon and Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau.
                    My dissertation developed analytic performance models for storage systems and new approximations for queue length distributions.
                    Prior to attending UW, I worked as a software engineer at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM, applying computer vision
                    algorithms to national security problems. My bachelor's and master's degrees are from the University of Florida.

                <p>Data structures and algorithms sit at the heart of the computer science curriculum, but even excellent students often finish their data structures course
                with no idea how the material applies to real software development.</p>

                <p>This book takes an active learning approach to the core undergraduate data structures course. Each theoretical topic is paired with at least one 
                significant project that illustrates its application and builds students' programming skills. The projects are interdisciplinary, and include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fractal art generators</li>
                    <li>Artificial life simulations</li>
                    <li>A tiny web browser</li>
                    <li>A textual search engine for a Shakespeare play</li>
                    <li>Password cracking</li>
                    <li>Particle effects graphics</li>
                </ul>
                Some of the projects are proven classics, but most are new, having been developed for my own classes over the past decade. Students will build
                key skills in object-oriented programming and gain familiarity with Java's graphics and user input frameworks.
                </p>

                <p>Instructors who adopt the text have access to lecture slides, exercise solutions, a test bank, and a chapter-by-chapter teaching guide to help
                you use the book in your own course.</p>

                <p>The book is available from <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-java/CE4F67C1DAEF99C779E793C455DD8A24#overview">Cambridge University Press</a>

              <p>New large-language AI models are challenging instructors, but can also open new opportunities for teaching and learning. 
                  It's time to move beyond simply <i>policing</i> AI use and show our students how to use AI 
                in a reflective, collaborative way.</p>

                <p>I offer a one-day in-person workshop to help faculty develop AI-first assignments and courses, drawing upon my own
                experience using AI in the classroom, resources I've developed for the Rollins faculty, and the best ideas from other
                leading AI-engaged professors. Attendees will leave with:
                <ul>
                    <li>Concrete examples of successful assignments you can adapt to your own classes</li>
